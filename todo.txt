merge map and beacon part into the project

in the map/beacon part, use UserLocation.setLatitude( .. ) and UserLocation.setLongitude( .. ) to set the users location, either gps or closest known beacon

in map part, handle cases when getLastKnownLocation() returns null by sending location updates requests.
on location changed, set UserLocation again to either the gps loc. or the closest beacon

add feature for storing new beacons in the cloud when you find them (maybe giving them the location of the user at that moment)
