Microphone
probably using MediaRecorder ? I don't want to record anything though
follow which approach? research
maybe AudioRecord, it allows to store raw data in a buffer without saving to a file
I have the soundmonitor now
TODO: the getSound() method, I should maybe do some averages over samples every tot seconds of the registration
maybe in a Thread, using sleep

Location?
probably to do in the map part
