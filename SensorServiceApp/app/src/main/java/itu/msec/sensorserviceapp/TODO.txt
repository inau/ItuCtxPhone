the map part has to tell UserLocation where is the user,
that would be either the GPS location or the closest ITU (or known) ibeacon location


initial

Microphone
probably using MediaRecorder ? I don't want to record anything though
follow which approach? research
maybe AudioRecord, it allows to store raw data in a buffer without saving to a file
I have the soundmonitor now
maybe in a Thread, using sleep

Location?
probably to do in the map part
