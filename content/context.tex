\section{Context Monitors}




implemented sensors
we use 3 context monitors in the app:
	an atmopsheric pressure monitor,
	an ambient tempearatutre monitor,
	a sound recorder, that records and stores the level of noise around the device.

all these monitors work in the background without the user interaction,
and they send the collected data to the cloud based storage service, together with the location of the user to contextualize that information.
the idea behind this sensors choices is that they can be relevant for understanding the environmental conditions of a certain place, that a person can check on the web service.
In regard to ITU locations, the sound monitor will hopefully show if a certain place is a good place where to study, while pressure and temperature can give informations about the weather conditions. atmospheric pressure is an indicator of rain chances.
