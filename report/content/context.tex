\subsection{context monitoring}

The process of monitoring the context information happens in the background, without involving the user.
All the monitoring is handled by a service on the mobile device of the user.
The context information obtained is of three types: atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature, and level of sound. 
Atmospheric pressure is measured in hPa (millibar) and ambient temperature in degree Celsius.
Each type has its own context monitor that runs on its own thread.
The detections are performed once every a fixed interval of time, and only when possible. In fact, not every modern devices are equipped with pressure or temperature sensors, in those cases the monitoring would not be possible for the specific types.
The sound monitor records sound through the device's microphone over short intervals of time, then computes the average sound amplitude.
Once that the context information is available, it is sent to the web service together with the location where that information was recorded (the user location)
