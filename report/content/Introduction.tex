The project's objective is that to create a pervasive cloud-based context-aware system. 
The system created is based on two technologies: an Android application for smartphones that can sense context data, and a cloud-based infrastructure, based on Google App Engine, that stores such information relating it to its physical location.

\section{Introduction}
This report is part of the first mandatory assignment in the course Pervasive Computing at the IT-University of Copenhagen (ITU), relating to the subject of context aware systems.
 The purpose of this project is to create a mobile application for Android, supported by ITU iBeacon infrastructure and by a  cloud based service, able to sense, store, and show context information about geographic locations.
